# ahb_lite_sdram
Simple SDRAM controller for MIPSfpga+ system AHB-Lite bus.

- [x] standalone work in simulator
- [ ] standalone work on hardware (Terasic board)
- [ ] work as a part of MIPSfpga+ in simulator
- [ ] work as a part of MIPSfpga+ on hardware
- [ ] merging to MIPSfpga+ repository

Micron Technology, Inc. ("MTI") SDRAM Verilog model (v2.3) is used for simulation.

[MIPSfpga+ / mipsfpga-plus / MFP] (https://github.com/MIPSfpga/mipsfpga-plus) is a cleaned-up and improved variant of MIPSfpga-based system.
